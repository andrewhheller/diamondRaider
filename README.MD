# Diamond Raider

_The year is 2157._

Diamonds have been discovered in the atmosphere of Saturn.  The Galactic Mining Guild has taken control of Saturn and control the new diamond "gold" rush in space!

But you won't stand for that.  Smuggler, treasure hunter.  Saturn's diamonds are waiting!

After slipping past Guild security, your cargo hold is stock full of diamonds.  But can you escape the guild's attack force waiting just beyond Saturn's orbit?

**Play in full screen mode and good luck!!**

_The year is 2157._

Diamonds have been discovered in the atmosphere of Saturn.  The Galactic Mining Guild has taken control of Saturn and control the new diamond "gold rush" in space!

But you're not one to play by the Guild's rules.  Smuggler, treasure hunter.  Saturn's diamonds are waiting!

After slipping past Guild security, your cargo hold is stock full of diamonds.  But can you escape the guild's attack force waiting just beyond Saturn's orbit?
